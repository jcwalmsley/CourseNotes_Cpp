Control statements:

Writing modular code for use in multiple projects reduces repetition.

The low level code directly controls the computer hardware achieving
optimal performance in terms of reliability, speed and energy use.

Its ability for abstractions allow the creation of high level systems designs.

This module will be covering:
    • if else statements
    • for loops
    • while loops
    • switch statements

Including a review of:
    • Relational Operators / booleans / logical Statements
        ==
        !=
        >
        <
        <=
        <=
