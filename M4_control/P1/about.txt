Practice using:

if, statements:

if(boolean expression)
{
    //statements to execute if above expression is true
}

if, else statements:

if(must be a boolean expression)
{
    //statements to execute "if" expression is true
}
else
{
    //statements to execute "if" expression is false
}

and if, else if, else statements:

if(boolean expression)
{
    //statements to execute "if" the boolean expression is true
}
else if (boolean expression #2)
{
    //statements to execute if the 'else if' boolean expression  #2 is true
}

else
{
    //statements to execute if the boolean expressions
    //'if' and 'else if'  are false
}
