/*
    Can you think of a problem that classes can solve?
    This program will attempt to store student information.
    Write this program such that it sorts the student data being stored by:
        Student Name
        Student Number
        Student Graduation Date

        Information on 5 students is provided.

        Sort students by name, then by number, then by graduation date.

        Print student information after each sort.

    It is not expected that you can successfully write this program but give it
    your best shot without using classes.

    The following information is provided:
        student1: Name: Joe Lime, ID#15, Grad. Date: 2019
        student2: Name: Bob Green, ID#3, Grad. Date: 2020
        student3: Name: SallyAnne Green , ID#1, Grad. Date: 2017
        student4: Name: Annie Blue, ID#10, Grad. Date: 2020
        student5: Name: Jose Lemon, ID#25, Grad. Date: 2016

    Use the general format:
    main.cpp
    main.hpp
*/



#include"main.hpp"
#include<string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //sort by name, then by number, then by gradDate
    return 0;
}
