    Can you think of a problem that classes can solve?
    Write a program to store student information.
    Write this program in such a wat that it can sort the student data being stored by:
        Student Name
        Student Number
        Student Graduation Date

        Information on 5 students is provided.

        The program meets expected criteria when it can:
            Sort students by name, then by number, then by graduation date.
            Print student information after each sort.

    It is not expected for you to be able to successfully write this program without
    using classesbut give it your best shot .

    The following information is provided:
        student1: Name: Joe Lime, ID#15, Grad. Date: 2019
        student2: Name: Bob Green, ID#3, Grad. Date: 2020
        student3: Name: SallyAnne Green , ID#1, Grad. Date: 2017
        student4: Name: Annie Blue, ID#10, Grad. Date: 2020
        student5: Name: Jose Lemon, ID#25, Grad. Date: 2016

    Use the general format:
    main.cpp
    main.hpp
*/
#include"main.hpp"
#include<string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    //sort by name, then by number, then by gradDate
    return 0;
