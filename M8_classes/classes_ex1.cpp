/*
    Before we discuss classes, I think it's a good idea to understand a problem that classes can solve. In this programming assignment I want you to track the following information:

Student Name
Student Number
Student Graduation Date
You will be given information for 5 students. You will need to sort the students by name, then sort them by number, and finally sort them by graduation date.

After each sort print out all the information on each of the students.

This quiz is meant to be a serious challenge and illustrate how difficult this task is in the absence of using classes. Please give this a shot to get a feel for how complex this task is without using classes. Once you have had enough of this experience please move on to the next section where we will discuss why this not the preferred approach to this task.
